# Features
The Recipe Search app includes the following features:

View recipe details, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.
2. Save favorite recipes to a user's profile for easy access
Create a shopping list for ingredients needed for a recipe
3. View and edit user profile information

# API Usage
The Recipe Search app uses the Edamam API to retrieve recipe and nutrition data. The API requires an app id and app key, which are passed in as environment variables.

To search for recipes, the app makes a GET request to the Edamam recipe search endpoint with the user's search query and any optional parameters (cuisine, meal type, dietary restrictions). The response includes an array of recipes, each with its own unique identifier (URI).

When a user selects a recipe, the app makes a second GET request to the Edamam recipe endpoint with the recipe's URI to retrieve detailed recipe and nutrition data. The response includes the recipe's ingredients, instructions, and a detailed nutritional breakdown.
