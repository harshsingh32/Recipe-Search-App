# Recipe Search App
This is a web application that allows users to search for healthy and nutritious food recipes using the Edamam's API. The app allows users to search for recipes based on specific ingredients, cuisine, meal type, and dietary restrictions. The app also provides information on the nutritional value of each recipe, including calorie count, macronutrient breakdown, and other key nutrients.

# API Usage
The Recipe Search app uses the Edamam API to retrieve recipe and nutrition data. The API requires an app id and app key, which are passed in as environment variables.

To search for recipes, the app makes a GET request to the Edamam recipe search endpoint with the user's search query and any optional parameters (cuisine, meal type, dietary restrictions). The response includes an array of recipes, each with its own unique identifier (URI).

When a user selects a recipe, the app makes a second GET request to the Edamam recipe endpoint with the recipe's URI to retrieve detailed recipe and nutrition data. The response includes the recipe's ingredients, instructions, and a detailed nutritional breakdown.
